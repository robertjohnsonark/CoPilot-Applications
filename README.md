This repo is showcasing work I did for my uncle who has been in the Tech space for 30+ years. 
This was a personal project he has been working on over the last decade and he gave it to me to update from .NET 3.1 -> .NET 6.0

In this project as I was updating to .NET 6.0, errors arose due to depricated or obsolete packages and technologies that were no longer comptabile with .NET 6.0
As errors popped up and I had to study the fixes, I learned a lot of new technologies I had never worked with before (.NET, IdentityServer4, EntityFramework, Swagger, SignalR, Automapper).
I removed any old or obsolete unnecessary code, updated commands and packages, and updated the code to follow the most up to date best practices according to Microsoft's Official Documentation.

Overall, from the original code I was given and downloaded from Azure DevOps repository, I ended up making around 4600 changes (lines of code).
I enjoyed getting new hands-on learning experience with technologies I had never used before and can now confidently add these skills and knowledge to my resume.
